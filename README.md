# Project-2---Website-Blocker

Problem statement:
In this current scenario of online education for school and college going students, where they have to study online from home on their laptop, how can we prevent them to open distracting websites during their study time?
We need a website blocker program which their parents can use. They just have to fill the URL of websites to be blocked and the duration of time for which they want it to be blocked.
For ex:
Website_list=[ www.youtube.com , www.instagram.com ,”www.facebook.com”]
Time = 10 am to 2 pm.


Pre-requisites: Hosts is a file name located at C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc location in
windows OS. If we want to block any website, we have to access that hosts file present at that
location and write the URL of the website at the end with a faulty IP.This process prevents our
computer to access the websites.
This python program can be used to automate this complete process.
Since the actual hosts file requires administrator rights to get access, I created a dummy hosts file to
perform the task. But the same tasks can be performed on actual hosts file after using the system as
administrator.
